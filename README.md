# Analysis of zstd

This analysis has been made for the "Computer technology" course in my first master year.
First, we analyse the compression algorithms and how it's working. Secondly we check how 
zstd store the compressed data (i.e. the format). Finally we compare zstd with the deflate
algorithm.
